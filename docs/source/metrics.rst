Metrics
=======

SmartDoc evaluates OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files using a mix of structural checks and semantic analysis powered by OpenAI's GPT-5-mini model. The key metrics assessed include:

* Coverage
    - Missing descriptions and examples
    - Undocumented parameters
* Clarity 
    - Ambiguous or vague descriptions
    - Inconsistent terminology
* Consistency
    - Uniform naming conventions
    - Standardized response formats

Why these metrics?
------------------

These are common pain points in real-world OAS files. They are conservative and will evolve over time.
